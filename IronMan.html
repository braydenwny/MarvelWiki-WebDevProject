During the kidnapping he suffers a severe injury in his chest, and after getting materials for their weapon, he instead makes himself a suit of armor to save his life and escape. After escaping he continues to develop the suit in different designs, and after keeping his identity hidden for a while, he eventually reveals his identity to the public as Iron Man, even becoing a founding member of the Avengers.</p2>

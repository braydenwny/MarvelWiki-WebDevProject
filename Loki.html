        <h2>Creation</h2>
        <p2>&emsp; Loki's original appearance was in a comic called Venus # 6 in 1949, however the version from the comics that has continued to modern day was created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby. His first appearance was in Journey into Mystery # 85 in October 1962. He is based off of the Norse God Loki.</p2>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p2>&emsp;Loki is a frost giant, and the adopted son of Loki. Due to being treated differently than his brother, Loki was very resentful, and was dubbed the God of Mischief due to his knack of causing mischief. He was very skilled in magic, and as he continued to grow up he lusted for power and revenge. He began using his tricks against Thor, and attempted to steal the rule of the land of Asgard many times, as well as fighting Eartho often.</p2>

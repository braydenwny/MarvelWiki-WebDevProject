        <h2>Creation</h2>
        <p2>&emsp;Iron Monger's first and main alias is Obadiah Stane, whose first appearance was in Iron Man # 163 in October 1982, but the Iron Monger armor that the alias is named after doesn't appead until Iron Man #200 in November 1985.</p2>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p2>&emsp;Obadiah worked with Tony Stark's Father, Howard Stark, and after he died he wanted to seize control of Stark Industries. He began trying to sabatoge Stark Industries. He takes it over for a while, but is chased out, and gets a team of scientists to make their own version of the Iron Man Armor, which he dubs the Iron Monger, and eventually uses the armor to fight iron Man, unknowing that Stark is the one piloting it.</p2>
        <br>
